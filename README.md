An agent-facing CLI and MCP server that lets AI coding agents, such as Codex or
Claude Code, design PCB electronics, mechanical parts, firmware interfaces,
sourcing choices, manufacturing outputs, and reviewable release artifacts. It
generates cross-domain candidates, records provenance and gate evidence, then
promotes only evidence-backed candidates through tiered release gates.

The product thesis is agentic hardware design with promotion discipline: AI
agents author and revise hardware candidates across electronics, mechanical,
firmware, sourcing, and manufacturing domains, while typed specs, deterministic
artifacts, structured failures, provenance, and release policy decide what can
advance. Maintained templates today cover three constrained board families.
Supporting a materially different family currently requires extending role sets,
component catalogs, templates, and sometimes generators.

The north star is for your AI agent to produce better reviewable hardware
candidates than today's disconnected EDA, CAD, firmware, sourcing, and release
tools by keeping generation, cross-domain consistency, and promotion evidence in
one loop. The implementation limits below describe what is proven today.

> **Evidence status:** the repository includes generated Gerbers, STEP files,
> BOM, firmware, reports, and a downloadable candidate bundle. It does not yet
> claim a fabricated, electrically brought-up, thermally qualified, or EMC-tested
> board.

## Known limits

- Three maintained board families are included: the STM32H7 robotics motor
  controller, the ESP32-S3 IoT sensor data logger, and the nRF52840 BLE sensor
  node. All component catalogs are fully reviewed; the ESP32-S3-WROOM-1 symbol
  and footprint were verified against the KiCad `RF_Module` library (2026-06-16).
- The Atopile adapter generates real `.ato` source from the electrical graph and
  runs `ato build`; the compile gate is active. When compile passes,
  `netlist_extract` and `graph_parity` are resolved via source-AST parity (signal
  declarations parsed from the `.ato` file and compared against the electrical
  graph). The three remaining post-compile gates (footprint parity, layout,
  manufacturing export) are `blocked` pending a configured KiCad plugin path.
- The `reference` backend is candidate-only. `tscircuit` and `kicad` are
  fabrication-release-eligible; `python_netlist` is netlist-release-eligible
  (produces `compiled_netlist.json` + firmware rather than Gerbers); `atopile`
  is HDL-source-release-eligible (`design.ato` + project metadata, no Gerbers).
  All release paths require every configured gate to pass.
- The complete cross-domain flow depends on native KiCad, OpenCASCADE,
  Freerouting, tscircuit, and Zephyr tooling. Validated paths: Linux container
  (CI, `ubuntu-latest`), macOS (`make toolchains`), and Windows (Python test
  suite via `windows-latest` CI — native toolchains not yet installed on Windows
  runners).
- Digital gates cannot certify fabrication quality, load thermals, EMI/EMC,
  vibration, abuse safety, ingress protection, transients, or connector life.
  These physical qualification gaps are stated explicitly in every generated
  report and cannot be closed by software.
- The tracked `r1` export is historical digital evidence. The current checked-in
  `reference` configuration is candidate-only and its release gate is expected to
  remain blocked unless a compiled backend is selected and all native gates pass.

## Run it

**No Python required — download a standalone binary** from the
[latest release](../../releases/latest):

| Platform | File |
|---|---|
| Linux x86-64 | `hw-{version}-linux-x86_64.tar.gz` |
| macOS arm64 | `hw-{version}-macos-arm64.tar.gz` |
| Windows x86-64 | `hw-{version}-windows-x86_64.zip` |

Each archive contains `hw` (CLI) and `hw-mcp` (MCP server). macOS users must
clear Gatekeeper quarantine after download: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ./hw ./hw-mcp`.

These binaries are the lightweight CLI and MCP distribution. Native release gates
(KiCad fabrication, Freerouting, Zephyr) require the container or locally installed
toolchains — the same limitation as the Python package.

**Or run directly with uv** (no install):

```bash
# MCP server
HW_PLATFORM_ROOT="$PWD" uvx --from 'hw-codesign-platform[mcp]' hw-mcp

# CLI
uvx --from hw-codesign-platform hw --root . create-project quadruped_robot_controller
```

**For full toolchains** (KiCad, OpenCASCADE, Freerouting, tscircuit, Zephyr):

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/workspace" ghcr.io/mrcha033/hw-cli:latest \
  export-review quadruped_robot_controller
```

New here? Follow [Zero to first candidate report](docs/first-run.md). Before
interpreting a green or blocked result, read the
[validation contract](docs/validation-contract.md). To change the included
design safely, read [Adapting the design system](docs/adapting-a-spec.md).

Missing `kicad-cli` returns `blocked`. Missing OpenCASCADE returns `blocked`.
A compiled error element in tscircuit returns `fail`. An unresolved critical
assumption blocks release. Decoupling proximity not yet modelled is reported as
explicitly deferred, not silently green. **Nothing is assumed to have worked.**

```json
{
  "gate": "tscircuit_compile",
  "status": "blocked",
  "failures": [{"code": "tool_unavailable", "message": "tscircuit compiler not found"}]
}
```

vs.

```json
{
  "gate": "tscircuit_compile",
  "status": "pass",
  "metrics": {"error_elements": 0, "pad_count": 183, "route_count": 217}
}
```

The difference is observable in JSON and enforced by the release gate.

## Current scope

A command-line and MCP-server design system for AI agents. From a structured
YAML spec plus agent-authored design actions, it generates PCB topology and
layout artifacts, parametric mechanical source, firmware pinmaps and interfaces,
sourcing decisions, manufacturing outputs, and review bundles. Release bundles
— Gerbers, STEP, BOM, firmware source, Zephyr devicetree — are produced only
after every configured gate reaches `pass`. Reference designs produce
`candidate` artifacts and are explicitly blocked from release. Physical
qualification risks (load thermals, EMI/EMC, vibration, abuse) are stated as
explicit gaps in every generated report and cannot be closed by software.
The primary authoring surface is semantic-first: requirements, electrical
graph, executable pin-name semantic schematic DSL, relative placement
constraints, mechanical contract, and firmware pinmap remain machine-readable
before native EDA/CAD outputs are emitted.

Three reference designs are included:

- **Robotics motor controller** — 4-layer PCB, STM32H7, 12 motor channels, CAN, 24 V VBAT
- **IoT sensor data logger** — 2-layer PCB, ESP32-S3-WROOM-1, USB-C power, I2C IMU (template: `sensor_data_logger`)
- **BLE sensor node** — 2-layer PCB, nRF52840-QIAA, LiPo charging (BQ24079 + BQ27441 + AP2112K), SHT31, 50×35 mm (template: `ble_sensor_node`)

### Backend maturity

| Backend | What works | Release position |
|---|---|---|
| KiCad | Native netlist, ERC/DRC, Freerouting round trip, and manufacturing export | Fabrication-release-eligible when every native gate passes |
| tscircuit | Pinned offline compile, Circuit JSON, graph/footprint parity, placement and routing checks | Fabrication-release-eligible with the KiCad manufacturing bridge and native gates |
| python_netlist | Deterministic netlist and parity checks; produces `compiled_netlist.json` + firmware | Netlist-release-eligible; layout and manufacturing gates are N/A (not blocking) |
| reference | Generates the included design intent and candidate artifacts | Candidate-only; used for tutorials and pipeline inspection |
| Atopile | Generates real `.ato` source; compile, netlist_extract, and graph_parity gates active; source-AST parity checks declared signals vs graph | HDL-source-release-eligible; not a fabrication release path |

This is not yet universal hardware design automation. Within the included board
families, users and agents can change supported electrical, mechanical,
firmware, sourcing, and manufacturing parameters, then generate and compare
candidate designs. A new topology requires a new role set/component catalog and
may require generator changes; see the adaptation guide.

---

## First workflow

The shortest useful workflow creates a cross-domain hardware candidate, runs the
available gates, writes a review bundle, and leaves promotion blocked when
release evidence is missing. The returned candidate includes the semantic-first
representation agents should reason over: requirements, electrical graph,
executable pin-name semantic schematic/code, relative placement source, mechanical
contract, and firmware pinmap.

```bash
uvx --from hw-codesign-platform hw --root . create-project first_board
uvx --from hw-codesign-platform hw --root . design-candidate first_board \
  --brief "16 channel 24V battery, peak 6A, STM32H7, IMU, emergency stop, Zephyr, 6-layer"
```

Expected result:

```json
{
  "status": "candidate",
  "iteration_id": "0001",
  "release_eligible": false,
  "requirements_update": {
    "status": "generated",
    "changed_paths": ["actuation.motor_channels", "..."]
  },
  "candidate": {
    "status": "candidate",
    "candidate_only": true
  },
  "semantic_representation": {
    "authoring_model": "semantic-first",
    "layers": {
      "electronics_graph": ".../electronics/generated/electrical_graph.json",
      "semantic_schematic": ".../electronics/generated/semantic/semantic_schematic.json",
      "semantic_schematic_code": ".../electronics/generated/semantic/semantic_schematic.py",
      "mechanical_contract": ".../mechanical/source/mechanical_contract.json",
      "firmware_pinmap": ".../firmware/generated/pinmap.json"
    }
  }
}
```

`release_eligible: false` means the design system preserved the generated
candidate but refused to promote it to release. The command writes specs,
generated intent and source, gate reports, an iteration snapshot, a review
bundle, and a candidate ZIP under `projects/first_board/`. The full file map and
interpretation are in the first-run guide.

## Generated example

The tracked robotics-controller example provides inspectable output without
requiring a local toolchain run:

- [Example and proof index](examples/robotics-motor-controller/README.md)
- [Complete generated bundle](projects/quadruped_robot_controller/exports/quadruped_robot_controller-r1.zip)
- [Gerbers](projects/quadruped_robot_controller/exports/r1/fabrication/gerbers.zip)
- [BOM](projects/quadruped_robot_controller/exports/r1/fabrication/bom.csv)
- [Assembly STEP](projects/quadruped_robot_controller/exports/r1/mechanical/assembly.step)
- [Validation report](projects/quadruped_robot_controller/exports/r1/docs/validation_report.json)
- [Known physical risks](projects/quadruped_robot_controller/exports/r1/docs/known_risks.md)

These are generated design artifacts and digital evidence, not proof of
fabrication or physical qualification. The current checked-in project spec uses
the candidate-only `reference` backend, so rerunning its current release gate is
expected to block until a compiled backend and all native gates are selected and
passed.

### Adoption milestones still open

- Publish a report screenshot or demo recording from a stable release workflow.
- Fabricate and bring up a generated board, then publish photographs, measured
  results, deviations, and the exact artifact bundle sent to manufacturing.
- Record thermal, transient, EMI/EMC, vibration, and connector qualification as
  physical evidence rather than software gate output.

## Capabilities

### Electronics topology authoring
- Agents author circuit blocks via `hw_add_circuit_block`: specify a ref,
  category, and connection map; the block is merged into the base topology, nets
  are re-derived, and ERC runs immediately — the gate result is returned in the
  same response
- `hw_propose_circuit_block` searches the curated component catalog by category
  and returns candidates with BOM-resolution status before any block is committed
- Agent-authored blocks stored under `agent_electronics.blocks` in
  `spec/agent_blocks.yaml`; distinct key prevents collision with `system.yaml`
  during spec merge
- ERC tolerates single-pin nets when every endpoint belongs to an agent block
  (incremental authoring support)

### Electronics backends
- Deterministic typed electrical graph with role-set resolver and curated
  component database; every resolved component has immutable provenance
- Shared source-generation step plus six-gate backend contract (compile →
  netlist → graph parity → footprint parity → layout → manufacturing export)
  enforced across all adapters
- Offline pinned **tscircuit 0.1.1491** PCB compile: Circuit JSON netlist, pad,
  placement, routing, and error-element validation
- **KiCad-native** adapter: native XML netlist extraction, ERC/DRC, Freerouting
  2.2.4 autoroute (DSN/SES round-trip), and Gerber/drill/position/BOM/STEP export
- **Python-netlist** adapter: netlist-release-eligible; produces
  `compiled_netlist.json` + firmware; layout and manufacturing gates are N/A
  rather than blocking — the release tier is explicitly `"netlist"` not fabrication
- **Atopile** adapter: emits `.ato` source and runs `ato build`; when compile
  passes, `netlist_extract` and `graph_parity` are resolved via source-AST parity;
  footprint/layout/manufacturing remain blocked pending a KiCad plugin path
- KiCad CLI and Zephyr `west` adapters with structured `tool_unavailable` reports
  when the tool is absent — they do not silently skip

### Placement
- Agent-authored placement constraints via `hw_set_placement_constraint`:
  express relationships (`adjacent_to`, `near_connector`) rather than absolute
  XY coordinates; the placer derives positions and the `placement_constraints`
  gate validates compliance immediately on write
- Constraint-driven placement proposal: structured, provenance-tagged placements
  with keepout, mounting-hole, connector-edge, decoupling-proximity, and
  thermal-spacing constraints
- Hard-blocks on off-board components, coincident centers, and connectors placed
  on the wrong board half; advisory warnings on coarse courtyard overlap and
  thermal spacing
- Decoupling proximity is represented as explicitly unenforced — cap-to-IC
  association is not in the netlist; the gate says so rather than claiming it
  checked something it did not
- Not authoritative: native ERC/DRC and the mechanical interference gate remain
  the release-blocking arbiters

### Mechanical
- Parametric 3D part design via `hw_design_part`: five part types
  (`pcb_mount_bracket`, `standoff_tower`, `cable_clip`, `din_rail_adapter`,
  `custom_enclosure_variant`), each with typed intent fields; parts are exported
  as STEP + STL with an FDM printability report (overhang, min wall, min hole)
- Spec-parameterized OpenCASCADE enclosure variants, mounting plates, frame
  brackets, connector cutouts, and board STEP assembly import/export
- Gates: valid solid, manifold STL, tolerance-aware board/component clearance,
  connector alignment, mounting-hole alignment, and measured BRep interference
  volume — nonzero interference returns `fail`
- Mechanical release requires the board STEP exported by the electronics backend;
  missing evidence returns `blocked`, not a fabricated pass

### Firmware module authoring
- Agents author firmware behavior modules via `hw_design_firmware_module`:
  four parametric behaviors (`timeout_shutdown`, `periodic_transmit`,
  `state_machine`, `sensor_poll`); each emits a `.c` file under
  `firmware/modules/` with matching Zephyr config entries
- `firmware_module_check` gate validates that every referenced signal exists in
  the pinmap and that motor/e-stop specs include a timeout_shutdown behavior
  that disables motor outputs; missing or misdirected safety behavior returns
  `fail`
- `firmware_interface_contract` verifies generated Zephyr config and bring-up
  stubs cover required board interfaces such as I2C, CAN, USB, e-stop fail-safe,
  motor PWM, and BLE before firmware build gates can promote the candidate
- Signal-level cross-domain consistency checked by
  `hw_check_cross_domain_consistency`: placement constraint refs verified against
  BOM, firmware module signals verified against pinmap

### Suppliers and BOM
- Normalized curated, LCSC/JLCPCB, Digi-Key, Mouser, and Octopart-style
  supplier adapters with datasheet evidence and availability gates
- Release checks consume only in-repository snapshots under `parts/suppliers`;
  no implicit network lookup at release time
- Known out-of-stock or discontinued parts fail; missing or stale evidence blocks
- Critical roles must have a curated alternate or an explicit single-source
  mitigation in the role set
- Manufacturer datasheet review evidence hashed into resolved component provenance

### Release
- Release gate requires every configured gate at `pass`, all critical assumptions
  resolved by a human, and every declared artifact present on disk with a matching
  hash
- Fabrication release: `tscircuit` and `kicad` backends (Gerber + drill + STEP);
  netlist release: `python_netlist` backend (`compiled_netlist.json` + firmware);
  HDL source release: `atopile` backend (`design.ato` + project metadata);
  `reference` is candidate-only

## Development setup

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install '.[dev,mcp]'
npm ci --ignore-scripts
.venv/bin/hw --root . create-project quadruped_robot_controller
.venv/bin/hw --root . iterate quadruped_robot_controller --no-external
```

Without native toolchains all external gates return `blocked`. That is the
expected and correct output when the tools are not installed.

Install the pinned native macOS backends and run the complete flow:

```bash
make toolchains
.venv/bin/hw --root . design-until-release quadruped_robot_controller --external
```

---

## MCP server

```bash
HW_PLATFORM_ROOT="$PWD" uvx --from 'hw-codesign-platform[mcp]' hw-mcp
```

Claude Desktop configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hw-codesign": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["--from", "hw-codesign-platform[mcp]", "hw-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "HW_PLATFORM_ROOT": "/absolute/path/to/hardware-workspace"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The configured workspace must be writable because projects, validation reports,
review bundles, and release artifacts are created beneath it.

### Canonical agent workflow

```
hw_get_capabilities          ← which backends and external tools are installed
hw_create_project / hw_open_project
hw_update_requirements       ← lowers natural-language requirements; returns release_blocking_failures

# Author topology, parts, placement, and firmware (new in Phases A–D)
hw_get_part_types            ← available parametric part types and their intent schemas
hw_design_part               ← design a 3D-printable part; returns STEP/STL + printability report
hw_propose_circuit_block     ← find catalog candidates for a given category before committing
hw_add_circuit_block         ← author a circuit block into the topology; ERC runs immediately
hw_set_placement_constraint  ← express adjacent_to / near_connector relationships; gate runs on write
hw_design_firmware_module    ← author a firmware behavior (timeout_shutdown, periodic_transmit, …)
hw_record_design_decision    ← log a decision + rationale to history/decisions.jsonl
hw_check_cross_domain_consistency ← validate placement refs against BOM, firmware signals against pinmap

hw_design_candidate          ← primary design workflow: generate semantic hardware candidate + gates + review bundle
hw_explore_design_space      ← rank backend, component, mechanical variant, and supplier-provider alternatives with evidence and blockers
hw_run_grounding_benchmark   ← adversarial check: wrong pinout/footprint/support/power/layout USB/RF/sourcing/net/firmware bring-up/dependencies must be caught
hw_generate_physical_qualification_plan ← define thermal/EMI/SI/PI/vibration/ingress/bring-up evidence contract
hw_record_physical_evidence  ← attach approved external test evidence to the physical_qualification gate
hw_generate_all              ← always candidate_only=true, release_eligible=false
hw_run_all_checks            ← include_external=true for full gate matrix
hw_review_release_readiness  ← non-authoritative summary: blocking gates, requirements, assumptions
hw_generate_repair_plan / hw_apply_repair_plan / hw_resolve_assumption
hw_check_release_gate        ← release_eligible=true when status==pass
hw_export_candidate_bundle   ← archive checkpoint (candidate_only=true, release_eligible=false)
hw_export_release_bundle     ← release_eligible=true when status==released; only reachable after gate passes
```

### Response envelope

Every tool response carries a consistent envelope that enforces the core invariant:
**candidate generated ≠ release passed ≠ fabrication qualified.**

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `release_eligible` | `false` on every tool; `true` only from `hw_check_release_gate` (status `pass`) and `hw_export_release_bundle` (status `released`) |
| `candidate_only` | `true` when the backend or gate state precludes release |
| `release_blocking_failures` | always-present list of strings; empty only when no blockers are known |

`hw_review_release_readiness` additionally carries:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `release_gate_authoritative` | always `false` — this tool reads persisted reports; only `hw_check_release_gate` is authoritative |
| `readiness_estimate` | `pass` / `fail` / `blocked` based on persisted reports; not a gate outcome |
| `data_freshness` | `current` / `possibly_stale` / `unknown` — heuristic based on spec vs report file timestamps; `possibly_stale` means the spec was modified after the last check run |

- `hw_export_release_bundle` — ZIP the release directory; sets `release_eligible=true` when status is `released`
- `hw_generate_design_report` — generate a human-readable design report markdown
- `hw_verify_release` — verify artifact integrity of the release directory against its manifest

### MCP resources

URI-template resources for structured reads without tool calls:

| Resource | Contents |
|---|---|
| `hw://project/{project}/release-gate` | Non-authoritative release readiness summary (`release_gate_authoritative: false`; use `hw_check_release_gate` for the authoritative gate) |
| `hw://project/{project}/spec` | Full merged project spec |
| `hw://project/{project}/requirements` | Active requirements: lowered and unresolved constraints |

---

## Distribution

- PyPI publishes `hw-codesign-platform` from semantic-version tags using Trusted
  Publishing.
- GHCR publishes `ghcr.io/mrcha033/hw-cli` with the full native toolchain for
  `linux/amd64`.
- Each GitHub release attaches a canonical `bundle.json` and its
  `review_bundle.schema.json` contract.
- Homebrew is deferred because native system dependencies make the container a
  more reliable installation path.
- conda-forge should be reconsidered when mixed Python/system dependency support
  becomes important to broader electronics-engineering adoption.
- MCP registry publication is deferred until the public tool interface and
  versioning policy are stable.

## Gate semantics

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `pass` | check ran and found no blocking finding |
| `fail` | check ran and found a violation |
| `blocked` | required tooling or prior decision was absent |
| `candidate` | artifact was generated but is not release-eligible |
| `generated` | source or spec was written; does not imply gate passage or release eligibility |
| `released` | all gates passed and the release bundle was exported |

`generated` ≠ `pass` ≠ `released`. Every tool emits `release_eligible: false`
unless it is `hw_check_release_gate` (status `pass`) or `hw_export_release_bundle`
(status `released`).

The complete release, adapter, hash, and physical-evidence rules are defined in
[Validation contract](docs/validation-contract.md).

Digital release evidence cannot certify load thermals, EMI/EMC, abuse safety,
vibration life, motor transients, ingress protection, or connector fatigue.
These remain explicit physical validation gaps in every generated report.
