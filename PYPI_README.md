**For supported board families, turn an agent brief into a reviewable hardware
candidate and an explicit fabrication-blocker report.**

`hw-codesign` provides the `hw` CLI, the `hw-mcp` MCP server, and a typed,
template-driven workflow for generating reviewable hardware candidates. Every
gate is reported as `pass`, `fail`, or `blocked`; software checks do not become
fabrication or physical-qualification claims.

## Install after publication

Python 3.11 or newer is required.

```bash
python -m pip install "hw-codesign[mcp]==0.1.3"
hw --help
```

## Start a candidate

```bash
mkdir my-hardware-workspace
cd my-hardware-workspace
hw --root . create-project my_usb_board --template rp2040_usb_device
hw --root . update-requirements my_usb_board \
  "Design a 2-layer RP2040 USB HID and CDC board powered from USB-C. Use Zephyr."
hw --root . design-candidate my_usb_board --brief \
  "Design a 2-layer RP2040 USB HID and CDC board powered from USB-C. Use Zephyr."
hw --root . export-standalone-review my_usb_board
```

The generated HTML review is self-contained. The tool is not an
arbitrary-prompt PCB oracle, and generated artifacts remain candidates until
all configured release and physical-evidence gates pass.
